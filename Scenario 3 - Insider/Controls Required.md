✔ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Least Privilege → Restrict access to only what's necessary for each user role to prevent data misuse or privilege abuse.

✔ Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Controls → Implement DLP policies to block, monitor, and alert on unauthorized data transfers, USB usage, and cloud uploads.

✔ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Critical Systems → Enforce MFA for privileged accounts, administrative access, and remote logins to prevent account misuse.

✔ Audit Logging & SIEM Monitoring → Ensure comprehensive logging of user actions and use SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) solutions for real-time anomaly detection.

✔ Insider Threat Awareness & Security Training → Educate employees on data protection, company policies, and consequences of insider threats to foster a security-aware culture.

✔ Strict Offboarding & Account Revocation Process → Immediately disable accounts for departing employees and review access permissions regularly to prevent unauthorized system access.
