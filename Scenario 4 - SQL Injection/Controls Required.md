*Controls Required:*
- Input Validation & Sanitization – Ensure all user inputs are validated, escaped, or sanitized before being processed by the database.
- Use Prepared Statements & Parameterized Queries – Replace concatenated SQL queries with prepared statements to prevent injection attempts.
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) – Deploy a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts before they reach the backend.
- Least Privilege Access (RBAC & IAM) – Restrict database user privileges, ensuring web applications can only perform necessary operations.
- Error Handling & Suppression – Disable detailed SQL error messages that could help attackers identify vulnerabilities.
- Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) – Continuously monitor and log SQL queries for suspicious patterns indicating an attack.
- Limit Database Permissions – Ensure web applications only have read/write access to necessary tables, preventing unauthorized data modification.
- Restrict Special Characters in User Input – Implement allowlists and disallow special characters like ', ", --, and ; in input fields.
- Regular Security Audits & Code Reviews – Conduct code reviews and vulnerability assessments to detect insecure SQL code.
- Rate Limiting & CAPTCHA – Implement rate limiting and CAPTCHA on login and search forms to mitigate automated SQL injection attacks.
- Stored Procedures – Use stored procedures instead of direct SQL queries when executing database commands.
- Enable Database Security Features – Utilize built-in database security features, such as query logging and access restrictions.
- Encrypt Sensitive Data – Encrypt personally identifiable information (PII) and medical data to protect against data exposure.
- Disable Unused Database Features – Turn off database features that are not needed, such as database shell access.
- Incident Response Plan for SQL Injection – Develop a SQL injection response plan, including real-time monitoring, containment, and remediation strategies.
