# Controls Required:

✔ Use Parameterized Queries & Prepared Statements → Prevent SQL injection by ensuring all database queries use parameterized inputs, eliminating the risk of malicious SQL execution.

✔ Input Validation & Sanitization → Implement strict input validation (allowlists, character limits) to prevent malicious SQL commands from being executed.

✔ Web Application Firewall (WAF) → Deploy a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts by filtering malicious requests in real-time.

✔ Least Privilege Database Access → Restrict database permissions so that applications only have access to the data they need, preventing unauthorized modifications.

✔ Error Handling & Suppression → Disable detailed SQL error messages to prevent attackers from learning database structures and exploiting vulnerabilities.

✔ Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) & Logging → Monitor and log all database transactions to detect suspicious queries and prevent unauthorized access.

✔ Regular Security Testing & Code Reviews → Conduct regular penetration testing, vulnerability scans, and code reviews to identify and fix SQLi risks before attackers can exploit them.
