## Kill Chain Attack Description: CareConnect360 SQL Injection Attack Scenario

## Stages of the Attack

### Origins
The attacker identifies CareConnect360 as a target due to its sensitive patient records and public-facing web application. The motivation could be: Financial gain (stealing patient data for resale). Espionage (accessing proprietary medical research). Destruction (manipulating or deleting medical records).

### Reconnaissance
The attacker gathers information on CareConnect360’s: Web application and API structure. Login forms, search fields, and input validation mechanisms. Database type (MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) through error messages or responses.

### Weaponization
The attacker crafts SQL injection payloads based on the database type, including: Authentication Bypass → Injecting OR '1'='1' to bypass login security. Data Extraction → Using UNION-based SQL injection to dump patient records. Data Manipulation → Executing UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or erase data. Privilege Escalation → Gaining admin-level access by modifying credentials.

### Delivery
The attacker injects SQL payloads into: Login fields to bypass authentication. Search bars or report queries to extract data. User input forms to manipulate or delete records.

### Exploitation
The SQL payload is executed, allowing the attacker to: Steal patient records, admin credentials, or financial data. Modify or delete medical information, disrupting healthcare services. Create new admin users to gain persistent access.

### Persistence
The attacker ensures continued access by: Creating hidden admin accounts. Deploying malware or backdoors via SQL commands. Disabling logging to evade detection.

### Actions on Objectives
After executing the attack, the attacker: Sells or leaks stolen data on the dark web. Modifies healthcare records to cause misdiagnoses. Deletes critical patient data, causing system downtime.
