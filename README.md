# **Threat Modeling Workshop Summary for Solaris - CareConnect360 - Patient Management System**

## **Introduction**
A **3-hour threat modelling workshop** was conducted to analyze **potential AI-driven cyber attacks** against the **web-facing healthcare application** **Solaris Care Connect 360**.

## **Attendees**
The workshop was attended by representatives from:  
- **CareConnect Engineering Team**  
- **Product Managers**  
- **DevEx Engineers**  
- **DevSecOps Team**  

## **Scope**
The workshop covered **four key attack scenarios**:  
1. **Phishing Attack**  
2. **Ransomware Attack**  
3. **Insider Attack**  
4. **SQL Injection Attack**  

## **Methodology**
The threat modelling workshop utilized:  
- **Cyber Kill Chain** → To analyze each attack’s **lifecycle** 
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** → To identify **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** for each attack
- **STRIDE Threat Model** → To **assess control gaps** and prioritize mitigations for Care Connect 360 as a whole  

The result was a **comprehensive risk assessment** of the Solaris Care Connect 360 Patient Management System.
