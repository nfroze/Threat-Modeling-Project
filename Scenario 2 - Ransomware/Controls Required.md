# Controls Required:

✔ Regular Offline & Immutable Backups → Ensure frequent, encrypted backups are stored offline or in immutable storage to recover data without paying ransom.

✔ Patch Management & Vulnerability Remediation → Keep software, OS, applications, and cloud services updated to eliminate vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware.

✔ Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) → Deploy advanced endpoint security solutions that detect and automatically block ransomware behavior in real-time.

✔ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Critical Systems → Enforce MFA on all admin accounts, remote access (VPN/RDP), and cloud services to prevent unauthorized access.

✔ Network Segmentation & Least Privilege Access (RBAC) → Isolate critical systems from general access and apply strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit lateral movement.

✔ Phishing Protection & Security Awareness Training → Block malicious emails via email security filters and train employees to recognize ransomware delivery methods.

✔ Incident Response & Disaster Recovery Plan → Have a tested ransomware response plan that includes early detection, containment, and rapid recovery procedures.
