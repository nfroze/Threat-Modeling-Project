*Controls Required:*
Regular Data Backups – Implement offline, encrypted, and immutable backups to ensure quick recovery without paying ransom.
Patch Management – Ensure operating systems, applications, and software are regularly updated to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.
Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) – Deploy advanced threat detection tools to monitor and block ransomware behavior in real-time.
Network Segmentation – Limit lateral movement of ransomware by isolating critical systems from general network access.
Email Filtering & Phishing Protection – Implement anti-phishing solutions to block malicious attachments and links.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) – Enforce MFA for all user accounts, reducing the risk of credential-based attacks.
Least Privilege Access (RBAC & IAM) – Apply role-based access control (RBAC) and strict IAM policies to minimize unauthorized access.
Application Whitelisting – Restrict execution of unauthorized programs to prevent malware execution.
Behavior-Based Anomaly Detection – Use AI-driven security monitoring to detect unusual system behaviors linked to ransomware.
DNS & Web Filtering – Block access to known malicious domains used for ransomware distribution.
Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) – Develop and regularly test an incident response plan to ensure rapid recovery from ransomware incidents.
Network Traffic Analysis & Logging – Monitor network traffic and system logs for early detection of suspicious activity.
Disable Macros & Executable Attachments – Block macro-enabled documents and untrusted executable attachments in emails.
Zero Trust Security Model – Implement Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to verify every access request before granting permissions.
Security Awareness Training – Educate employees on ransomware tactics, social engineering, and safe browsing habits.
